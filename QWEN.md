# Qwen Code Context for Agent Arena Project

## Python Virtual Environment Activation

This project uses a Python virtual environment managed by `uv`. To ensure the virtual environment is properly activated, run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This command should be executed from the project root directory (`/home/bruce/work/agent-arena`).

## Verifying Activation

Once activated, your shell prompt should change to include `(.venv)` at the beginning, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Important Note for Code Navigation

Do not search the `.history` directory, as it contains a full backup of every change and can significantly slow down searches.
